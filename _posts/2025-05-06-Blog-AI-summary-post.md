# Looking Back: A Summary of Previous Posts

Over the past few years, I've explored various topics on this blog, from technical setup to design methodology and research. Here's a brief overview of the key posts published so far:

## Jekyll and Technical Setup

My journey with Jekyll began with some initial setup challenges. In ["Jekyll and Bundle Setup"](../2022-06-07-4th.html) (June 2022), I documented the Ruby and Gems configuration process needed to get Jekyll working locally. This post serves as a useful reference for anyone setting up a similar environment.

## Design and Visualization Research

### A Taxonomy of Digital Product Visualization
In ["A Taxonomy of Digital Product Visualization"](../2022-06-09-A-Taxonomy-of-digital-product-visualisation.html) (June 2022), I outlined a framework for categorizing different approaches to digital product visualization, breaking it down into four distinct categories:
- Digital sketching
- Digital 2D rendering
- 3D concept development
- 3D product visualization

This post was intended as groundwork for a lecture series, focusing on the objectives of product visualization rather than just the technical skills.

### Data Management and Organization
["Cleaning House"](../2022-07-10-New-Broom.html) (July 2022) discusses the importance of proper data management in design projects. I shared lessons learned from reorganizing my drive spaces according to the FAIR principle (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).

### Blender vs Solidworks Comparison
In ["Red Dot: Blender vs Solidworks"](../2022-12-21-Red_Dot_Blender_vs_Solidworks.html) (December 2022), I conducted a detailed comparison of modeling workflows between Blender and SolidWorks by recreating the same objects in both applications. This practical comparison highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of each software for different design scenarios.

### Open Product Visualization
["Open Product Visualization"](../2022-06-07-Open-Product-Vis-KO.html) (June 2022) began exploring the use of open source tools in product design and visualization. I reflected on my journey with open source software from academic research to professional applications, questioning industry norms around proprietary software.

## AI and User Interface Design

["AI Supported Literature Review and Rapid Prototyping"](../2023-03-19-AI-prototyping-of-user-interfaces.html) (March 2023) details how I used AI (specifically GPT-4) to assist in rapidly prototyping user interfaces for a website serving Irish job seekers. The post documents the entire process of developing theoretical foundations, generating code, and implementing visualizations.

In a follow-up post ["AI Persona and Silicon Samples"](../2023-03-27-AI-persona-and-silicon-samples.html) (March 2023), I explored using AI to construct personas for design ethnography, creating a detailed fictional user named Dave to better understand user needs for employment resources.

## Moving Forward

This blog has evolved from technical documentation to exploring the intersection of design methodology, visualization techniques, and emerging technologies like AI. Future posts will continue to explore these themes, with a particular focus on open source tools and how they can enhance the design process.

I welcome your thoughts and suggestions for topics you'd like to see covered in upcoming posts!
